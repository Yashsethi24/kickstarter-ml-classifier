- `kickstarter_grading.xlsx`: Dataset used for grading purposes

## Notebooks
The `notebook` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that document the analysis:
- `Sethi_Yash_Individual_Project_v1.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook
- `Individual_Project-Yash-Sethi.ipynb`: Additional analysis notebook

## Documentation
- `Project Report.pdf`: Contains the final project report with analysis and findings
- `Problem Statement.pdf`: Contains the project requirements and guidelines

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Run the notebooks in the `notebook` directory

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (to be listed in requirements.txt)
